# Market Discovery — PC Hardware Monitoring Tools

## Purpose
Produce a structured competitive analysis of the PC hardware monitoring market to help position KAM Sentinel v1.2 and identify feature gaps, pricing opportunities, and underserved user segments.

## Research Targets
Always research these core competitors:
1. **MSI Afterburner** — GPU OC + overlay, free, most popular
2. **HWiNFO64** — deep hardware sensor data, free, power-user focused
3. **NZXT CAM** — polished UI, game overlay, freemium
4. **GPU-Z / CPU-Z** — single-purpose snapshot tools, free
5. **HWMonitor (CPUID)** — simple sensor viewer, free/pro
6. **OpenHardwareMonitor / LibreHardwareMonitor** — open source sensor library
7. **Rainmeter** — customizable desktop widgets, free
8. **AIDA64** — comprehensive, paid ($40+), professional
9. **Speccy** — system info snapshot, free/pro (Piriform)
10. **MangoHud** — Linux game overlay (cross-platform trend watch)

## Research Framework

### For each competitor, capture:
- **Price model**: Free / Freemium / One-time / Subscription
- **Platform**: Windows only / Cross-platform
- **Key features**: What it does well
- **Missing features**: What it lacks
- **UI quality**: 1-5 rating with notes
- **Target user**: Casual / Gamer / Enthusiast / Professional
- **Last updated**: Active development or abandoned?
- **Install friction**: Portable / Installer / Account required
- **Community size**: Reddit mentions, GitHub stars, download counts

### Market Gap Analysis
After researching all competitors, identify:
1. Features KAM Sentinel has that others lack
2. Features competitors have that KAM Sentinel should add
3. Underserved user segments
4. Pricing white space
5. Distribution advantages (portable .exe is rare)

### Positioning Matrix
Plot competitors on two axes:
- X-axis: Simple ←→ Powerful
- Y-axis: Free ←→ Paid

Identify which quadrant KAM Sentinel occupies and which is least crowded.

## Output Format
Produce a structured report with:
1. **Executive Summary** (3-5 sentences)
2. **Competitor Profiles** (one section per tool)
3. **Feature Comparison Table** (markdown table)
4. **Market Gap Analysis** (bullet points)
5. **KAM Sentinel Positioning** (where we win, where we're weak)
6. **Recommended Feature Priorities** (ranked by market opportunity)
7. **Go-to-Market Observations** (distribution, community, pricing)

## KAM Sentinel Unique Advantages to Highlight
- Hardware-aware smart thresholds (auto-detects CPU/GPU model limits)
- Portable single .exe — no install, no account
- Benchmarking against other machines (Phase 2)
- AI-assisted optimization suggestions (Phase 2)
- Open source friendly (GitHub)
- Built for enthusiasts who want actionable insights, not just raw data

## Search Strategy
Use web_search for each competitor with queries like:
- "[tool name] features 2025"
- "[tool name] vs alternatives reddit"
- "best PC monitoring software 2025"
- "MSI Afterburner alternative"
- "hardware monitoring tool market size"

Cross-reference with Reddit (r/hardware, r/pcgaming, r/overclocking) for real user pain points.
