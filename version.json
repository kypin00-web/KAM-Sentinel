  "changes": [
    "NEW: deploy.yml test gate job (ubuntu-latest) — runs tests first; build-windows and build-macos only start if tests pass",
    "NEW: release job needs: [test, build-windows, build-macos] — nothing deploys if any upstream job fails",
    "NEW: Section 14 in test_kam.py — 11 tests for scripts/installer.nsi existence/structure and deploy.yml NSIS fix + job dependency chain",
    "FIX: test_kam.py /api/shutdown test no longer actually POSTs to the endpoint (was calling os._exit, killing process before sections 12-14 ran)",
    "NEW: BugWatcher auto-fix pipeline — _fix_nsis_path, _fix_missing_module, _fix_encoding_false_positive applied and git-pushed automatically",
    "NEW: BugWatcher _git_push_fix + _wait_for_ci_run — pushes fix commit, waits up to 10 min for new CI run, logs green/still-failing outcome",
    "NEW: --wait flag for bugwatcher daemon — enables wait-for-green confirmation after auto-fix push"
